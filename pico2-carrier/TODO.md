# TODO - Hardware

- Finalise power circuitry
    - What battery connector to use? I have LP503035 battery which uses a 2-pin JST-P male connector.
    - Put thermistor somewhere decent, probably back of board.
- Triple check voltage/power requirements for components
- Check headers for signals not used but might be (excluding screen TP)
- Check IR footprint - I think its flipped
    - Worst case just have to have top-facing transceiver
